## Introduction
This Repository contains the study and research on **OpenCV**(Open Source Computer Vision Library) and it's applications in **Robotics Vision systems**.
<br>
The Focus is on understanding core concepts,**image processing techniques**,and how robots use vision to interact with real world. 

## What is OpenCV?
OpenCV is an **open-source library** used for **image and video processing**.<br>
Tools OpenCV provides:
- Read and process images
- Detect objects, faces, and edges
- Perform vision tasks
- Support robotics applications
### Key Features:
- Written in **C++** mainly, also **Java** and **Python** can be used
- Fast and optimized for real-time systems
- Mainly used in Robotics & AI
### OpenCV used in Robotics Vision
Robots use OpenCV to **see, analyze, and make decisions** based on input from cameras.
### Robotics Applications:
- **Object Detection** – Identifying objects 
- **Line Following Robots** – Detecting paths 
- **Obstacle Avoidance** – Identifying obstacles using Vision
- **Face Recognition** – Used in security
- **Navigation** – Assisting robots to move smartly

## Basic Image Processing Tasks
Image processing is the foundation of computer vision.  
### 1️.Image Reading & Display
- Load images from files or camera
- Display images on screen
### 2️.Grayscale Conversion
- Converts colored images into shades of gray
- Reduces complexity and processing time
### 3️.Image Blurring
- Reduces noise from images
- Helps in smoother edge detection
### 4️.Edge Detection
- Detects boundaries of objects
- Helps in shape and object recognition
### 5️.Thresholding
- Converts images into binary
- Used for object segmentation

## Explore Computer Vision Concepts
Computer Vision enables machines to **interpret and understand visual data** like humans.
### Key Concepts:
- **Image & Video Processing**
- **Pixels and Resolution**
- **Contours** 
- **Feature Detection** 
- **Object Detection vs Image Classification**
  - *Classification*: What is in the image?
  - *Detection*: Where is the object in the image?
## Tools & Technologies Used
- OpenCV Library
- C++ / Python
- Images captured using camera
