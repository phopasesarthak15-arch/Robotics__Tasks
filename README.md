## Introduction
This Repository contains the study and research on **OpenCV**(Open Source Computer Vision Library) and it's applications in **Robotics Vision systems**.
<br>
The Focus is on understanding core concepts,**image processing techniques**,and how robots use vision to interact with real world. 

## What is OpenCV?
OpenCV is an **open-source library** used for **image and video processing**.
<br>
Tools OpenCV provides:
- Read and process images
- Detect objects, faces, and edges
- Perform vision tasks
- Support robotics applications
### Key Features:
- Written in **C++** mainly, also **Java** and **Python** can be used
- Fast and optimized for real-time systems
- Mainly used in Robotics & AI
### OpenCV used in Robotics Vision
Robots use OpenCV to **see, analyze, and make decisions** based on input from cameras.
### Robotics Applications:
- **Object Detection** – Identifying objects 
- **Line Following Robots** – Detecting paths 
- **Obstacle Avoidance** – Identifying obstacles using Vision
- **Face Recognition** – Used in security
- **Navigation** – Assisting robots to move smartly
